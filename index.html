                    <h3>Exploring the Role of RNA-Binding Proteins</h3>
                    <p>Role of RNA-Binding Proteins in Stress Granule Formation and Function. Cells adapt to
                        environmental and physiological stress by reorganizing their molecular architecture, forming
                        dynamic RNA-protein assemblies that protect essential processes such as RNA regulation and
                        protein synthesis. Among these assemblies, stress granules serve as key hubs for mRNA triage,
                        preserving transcript stability and modulating translation during stress.</p>

                    <p>We study the molecular principles that shape stress granule behavior—how they assemble,
                        disassemble, and adapt under stress. A key focus is understanding whether and how variations in
                        regulatory proteins alter granule size, number, or dynamics, and what these changes mean for RNA
                        regulation and cellular function.</p>

                    <p>Using advanced imaging, protein interaction mapping, and functional assays, we seek to decode the
                        molecular framework that underpins RNA surveillance and translational control within stress
                        granules. These insights are key to understanding fundamental cell biology and revealing how
                        failures in RNA regulatory systems contribute to neurological disorders and other complex
                        diseases.</p>

                    <h3>RNA Binding Factors in Cilia Biology and Ciliopathies</h3>
                    <p>Cilia are highly specialized organelles essential for numerous cellular functions, including
                        signal transduction, fluid movement, and embryonic development. Defects in the formation or
                        function of cilia lead to a group of disorders collectively known as ciliopathies, often
                        characterized by developmental anomalies affecting multiple organ systems. Recent research has
                        highlighted the emerging role of RNA-binding factors in regulating cilia biogenesis and
                        function.</p>

                    <p>These proteins are crucial for precise RNA processing, particularly alternative splicing of genes
                        essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling. Misregulation or mutations in such factors can
                        disrupt the splicing of ciliary genes, leading to abnormal cilia structure or signaling defects,
                        and ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the molecular interplay between RNA processing machinery and ciliary pathways offers
                        new insights into the etiology of these complex disorders and opens avenues for potential

                    <h3>Protein Trafficking & Autophagy</h3>
                    <p>Our lab focuses on understanding how disruptions in protein trafficking contribute to epilepsy
                        and other neurological disorders. We study proteins that regulate the movement and localization
                        of key neuronal components, such as ion channels and receptors, which are essential for
                        maintaining normal brain activity. Defective trafficking of these proteins can lead to imbalances
                        in neuronal signaling and increase the risk of seizure activity.</p>

                    <p>By identifying and characterizing trafficking-related proteins implicated in epilepsy, we aim to
                        uncover the molecular mechanisms driving the disease. Our approach combines genetic models,
                        molecular biology, and advanced imaging to explore how these pathways are altered in the
                        epileptic brain. This research could pave the way for targeted therapies that restore proper

                    <h3>Investigating Chromatin Association and Transcriptional Regulatory Functions of Novel Factors
                    </h3>
                    <p>This research area focuses on understanding whether specific proteins or genes of interest play a
                        role in chromatin biology or transcriptional regulation. A central objective is to determine
                        whether these factors function as transcription factors, chromatin-associated proteins, or
                        modulators of gene expression through interactions with chromatin architecture.</p>

                    <p>By using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), genome-wide binding
                        profiles are generated to determine whether these factors associate with chromatin, bind
                        regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers, or function as transcription factors. The
                        binding data are integrated with transcriptomic and epigenomic information to assess
                        correlations with gene expression and chromatin states.</p>

                    <p>This approach helps identify whether the factors act directly on DNA or modulate chromatin
                        structure indirectly. The ultimate goal is to reveal novel mechanisms of gene regulation and

                    <h3>RNA Splicing Mechanisms and Gene Regulation</h3>
                    <p>Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism that enables cells to generate protein diversity
                        from a limited number of genes, playing critical roles in development, cellular differentiation,
                        and disease. Our research investigates the molecular mechanisms governing splice site
                        recognition, spliceosome assembly, and the regulatory networks that control tissue-specific and
                        context-dependent splicing patterns.</p>

                    <p>We employ genome-wide approaches including RNA-seq and CLIP-seq to map splicing landscapes and
                        identify regulatory elements that influence splice site selection. By integrating computational
                        predictions with experimental validation, we characterize splicing factors and their target
                        transcripts, revealing how aberrant splicing contributes to human disease, particularly
                        neurological disorders and cancer.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the interplay between splicing machinery, chromatin modifications, and
                        transcriptional regulation provides insights into how cells coordinate gene expression programs.

                    DFNA9 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by late-onset, non-syndromic hearing loss, and
                    vestibular dysfunction. Mutations in the COCH (coagulation factor C homology) gene encoding cochlin
                    are etiologically linked to DFNA9. Here, we report that cochlins containing DFNA9-linked mutations
                    (p.P51S, p.V66G, p.G88E, p.I109T, p.W117R, p.V123E, and p.C162Y) demonstrate reduced cleavage by
                    aggrecanase. The novel COCH p.V123E mutation shows impaired cochlin post-translational processing
                    and secretion, providing new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant
                    hearing loss.

                    We analysed a four-generation family with several of its members diagnosed for BD employing a
                    combination of genetic linkage and exome analysis. We obtained suggestive LOD score for a chromosome
                    1 and a chromosome 6 marker (D1S410; LOD = 3.01, θ = 0; and D6S289; LOD = 1.58, θ = 0). Manual
                    haplotyping of the regions encompassing these two markers helped delimit a critical genomic interval
                    of 32.44 Mb (D1S2700-D1S435; chromosome 1p31.1-13.2) and another of 10.34 Mb (D6S470-D6S422;
                    chromosome 6p22.3-22.2). We examined the exomic sequences corresponding to these two intervals and
                    found rare variants, NM_181712.4: c.2461G>T (p.Asp821Tyr) in KANK4 at 1p31.1-13.2; and
                    NM_006366:c.-93G>A, in the 5' UTR of CAP2 at 6p22.3-22.2. Our study suggests involvement of KANK4 or
                    CAP2 or both in BD in this family. Further analysis of these two genes in BD patients and functional
                    evaluation of the allelic variants identified are suggested.
